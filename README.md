# Part 3
Some of the pros of TDD include that it automates the testing process, covers the full extent of the code, and fits well with the agile development cycle. This is because creating unit tests before writing code allows you to write and test small portions of functionality at a time without necessarily having achieved integration with the rest of the product at that point.

Some cons of test-driven development could be that the unit tests need to be modified if new ideas come about during the coding process after the unit tests have already been created. As such change in code requires changes in tests, and if the tests are not maintained, it will worsen from there such that the project will no longer follow test-driven development. Another issue is the lack of UI testing functionality. TDD could slow down development of projects with minimal complicated functionality and integrating parts, where flaws are more easily found by testing the application manually.
